# Building Modern Web Applications

The web development landscape has evolved dramatically. Let's explore the modern stack and tools that power today's web applications.

## The Modern Frontend Stack

### Framework Choices

**React**
- Component-based architecture
- Virtual DOM for performance
- Massive ecosystem

**Vue**
- Progressive framework
- Easy learning curve
- Great documentation

**Svelte**
- Compile-time framework
- No virtual DOM
- Smaller bundle sizes

## State Management

Managing state is crucial in modern web apps:

- **Redux** - Predictable state container
- **Zustand** - Minimal boilerplate
- **Jotai** - Atomic state management

## Build Tools

### Vite
Fast, modern build tool with:
- Lightning-fast HMR
- Optimized builds
- Plugin ecosystem

### Webpack
The veteran bundler:
- Highly configurable
- Rich plugin ecosystem
- Battle-tested

## Styling Solutions

1. **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS
2. **CSS Modules** - Scoped styling
3. **Styled Components** - CSS-in-JS

## Best Practices

- Component composition over inheritance
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Optimize bundle sizes

## Next Steps

In the following articles, we'll build a complete web application from scratch using these modern tools.
